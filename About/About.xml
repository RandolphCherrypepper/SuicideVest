Need to put some of those incapable colonists to good use? Is your human leather hat collection overflowing?

Put your best meat shields on the front line with the suicide vest! Guaranteed to take out at least one pawn!

Recommends the Remove From Anything Outfit mod from Randolph Cherrypepper. Without RFAO, you might want to modify your outfits so that the default Anything outfit does not allow the Suicide Vest. What do I know? I'm not your boss. Do what you wanna.

Requires the Apparel Gizmos From Comps mod from Randolph Cherrypepper.

Compatibility note: This should mix with other mods without issue.

Mod Order: Anywhere below AGFC.
